<a id="project-idea" class="anchor" href="#project-idea" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Project Idea</strong>
</h3>

<p>The project will focus on exploring the possibility of editing text in VR. That said, we will use Unity as our engine. On top of unity we will build the experience around three major components:</p>

<h3>
<a id="novelty" class="anchor" href="#novelty" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Novelty</strong>
</h3>

<p>There are a lot of VR demos out there, but we haven’t seen many that explores the experience of text editing in VR. Many programmers prefer to work with two monitors and we’ve seen a matrix of 9 monitors at an investment banker’s desk. Working in VR makes use of the free, unlimited space. During our research we came across related projects as follows:</p>

<p>Ibex: inserts your desktop in an outdoors scene
mOculus: maya plugin that renders the model as well as display the editor in VR space
RiftSketch: Live coding Javascript and Three.js (WebGL/WebVR)</p>

<p>But none of the existing projects have been able to open up infinite numbers of text editors, or be able to switch the surrounding environment for the VR workstation. </p>

<a id="technical-challenges" class="anchor" href="#technical-challenges" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Technical Challenges</strong>
</h3>

<h4>
<a id="text-editor" class="anchor" href="#text-editor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Text editor:</h4>

<p>How do we take the basic functionalities in an editor - opening/saving/closing a file, multiple windows, consoles, switching between windows - and make it feel natural and superior in VR.</p>

<p>We encounter problem while try to activate text boxes and enter edit mode. We though about using a mouse to select the window we want to activate or using keyboard to switch active windows. However all does not contribute well to convenience and player comfort.In the end we use Raycast technology to have the player eye camera shoot out a ray to the text editor he/she's looking at and select the text editor that first had a collision with the ray.</p>

<h4>
<a id="environment" class="anchor" href="#environment" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Environment:</h4>

<p>One of the challenge we encounter is how to switch environment for the player. We solved this by creating a list of environment names, and having a script running at start of the project, listening for key press to trigger the function to load next environment in list. When the index of the environment reaches the end of the list, it wraps around to the head of the list.</p>

<p>Another challenge is what type of environment we want, should it be a terrain with bunch of lightnings and objects or should it be just a sky box and where could we get those environments? To make rendering more efficient, we use a Skybox instead of terrain and objects for the representation of environment.Thus it is more efficient to load the background environment. We assume that a player will not walk around while reading and text editing.</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-interface" class="anchor" href="#user-interface" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>User interface:</h4>

<p>We encounter tech problems with drawing cross-hair to indicate which object the user is looking at.
However, having a persistent cross-hair would mess up with existing background environment. As the background environments  are Skyboxes in which an object could appear near to us and even nearer than the cross-hair. In this case, we would see cross-hair behind the background or having a double-image cross-hair. To fix this, we edit the RayCast script to disable the rendering of the cross-hair when there it is hitting no objects,</p>

<a id="what-works-well" class="anchor" href="#what-works-well" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What Works Well</h3>

<h4>
<a id="text-editor-1" class="anchor" href="#text-editor-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Text editor:</h4>

<p>We have basic functions of the text editor set up.
We have can type/edit/delete text in the text editor.
While looking at the window, hold Alt + B to move the window around with your head
While holding down Alt + B, use the following keys to customize the window:</p>

<ul>
<li>  J: bring it closer</li>
<li>  K: bring it further</li>
<li>  M: make it wider</li>
<li>  ,: make it narrower</li>
<li>  U: make it taller</li>
<li>  I: make it shorter</li>
</ul>

<p>Press command+space and launch a spotlight search bar to quickly search/open files, websites</p>

<h4>
<a id="environment-1" class="anchor" href="#environment-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Environment:</h4>

<p>What kind of background makes the user most efficient? It could be a lakeside cabin or a trippy wormhole. Maybe helpful for writing novels. The trick is one could be most efficient in a open space environment like a forest or skyline while the other could be most efficient in a closed environment such as a study room. To adjust such diversity, we include multiple types of environment to suit different users' preferences: sunrise, sunset, forests, study room, space station etc.</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-interface-1" class="anchor" href="#user-interface-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>User interface:</h4>

<p>We have a launch bar to aid us open existing files or browser in VR.
Type "new text file" to open a blank window
Launch any webpage, eg. by typing "<a href="http://youtube.com">http://youtube.com</a>"
We have a cross hair to indicate where the center of user's view port. This is to help the user know exact which screen he is looking at so the user would not be confused while try to activate/edit a text editor while in the meantime, multiple of such exists.</p>

</h3>

<h4>
<a id="3d-sound" class="anchor" href="#3d-sound" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3D Sound</h4>

<p>In the future, we could manipulate the sound produced by stereo speakers, surround-sound speakers, speaker-arrays, or headphones. This frequently involves the virtual placement of sound sources anywhere in three-dimensional space, including behind, above or below the listener.</p>

<p>To achieve that, we may need to purchase a set of stereo speakers and place them strategically at different locations of the lab. While at the same time implement some of the 3D technologies also convert binaural recordings to stereo recordings. MorrowSoundTrue3D converts binaural, stereo, 5.1 and other formats to 8.1 single and multiple zone 3D sound experiences in realtime.</p>

<h4>
<a id="full-featured-text-editor" class="anchor" href="#full-featured-text-editor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Full-featured Text Editor</h4>

<p>Right now the text editor has limited features, we are able to open new files and existing files.
However, we would not be able to save files after editing.
Another feature we did not implement is the scroll bar feature. As for now when we open a very big file we could only see part of the file.
Next import future work of the text editor would be able to open multiple types of files. For now, we only display plain text files. We wish to include compatibility with PDF, Word documents as well.</p>

<h4>
<a id="search-bar-suggestion" class="anchor" href="#search-bar-suggestion" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search Bar Suggestion</h4>

<p>Currently the search bar does not automatically guesses what you're searching for as you type into the search box. Depending on the search query, user's might prefer showing suggestions for existing matching file names, suggestions from search history, spelling corrections, sponsored links, or top websites matching the string etc.</p>

<h3>
<a id="why-its-a-comfortable-experience" class="anchor" href="#why-its-a-comfortable-experience" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why it's a comfortable experience</h3>

<p>We try to make this to be as comfortable as possible by follow most of the the Oculus Best Practices
Allow the user to edit in the environment for potentially extended time. We intend to follow most of the Oculus Best Practices.</p>

<a id="how-we-use-the-course-concepts" class="anchor" href="#how-we-use-the-course-concepts" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How we use the course concepts</h3>

<h4>
<a id="depth-perception" class="anchor" href="#depth-perception" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Depth Perception</h4>

<p>Depth perception is one of the concepts we learned in class. It's a visual ability to perceive the world in three dimension and the distance of an object. Depth sensation is the corresponding term for animals, since although it is known that animals can sense the distance of an object. We used this concept constantly while implementing our project. The cross-hair bug is caused by mis-perception of depth of the virtual object in the Skybox. The Skybox's objects are actually placed further than the crosshair, however some of the skybox scene such as study room has objects that appears to be near to us which makes the display of crosshair glitched as a double crosshair or it appears that we could see though near objects to get the view of the crosshair.</p>

<h4>
<a id="3d-rotationsquaternions" class="anchor" href="#3d-rotationsquaternions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3D rotations/quaternions</h4>

<p>We use concepts of quaternions for our text editor screen control. Specifically, we have a feature to lock the text editor screen to rotate along with the user's orientation. We also borrowed this idea from one of the mp problem to have the imitation face rotate along while the head track is rotated.</p>
