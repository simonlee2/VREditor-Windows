</h3>

<p>The project will focus on exploring the possibility of editing text in VR. That said, we will use Unity as our engine. On top of unity we will build the experience around three major components:</p>

<h3>
<a id="novelty" class="anchor" href="#novelty" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Novelty</strong>
</h3>

<p>There are a lot of VR demos out there, but we haven’t seen many that explores the experience of text editing in VR. Many programmers prefer to work with two monitors and we’ve seen a matrix of 9 monitors at an investment banker’s desk. Working in VR makes use of the free, unlimited space. During our research we came across related projects as follows:</p>

<p>Ibex: inserts your desktop in an outdoors scene
mOculus: maya plugin that renders the model as well as display the editor in VR space
RiftSketch: Live coding Javascript and Three.js (WebGL/WebVR)</p>

<p>But none of the existing projects have been able to open up infinite numbers of text editors, or be able to switch the surrounding environment for the VR workstation. </p>

</h3>

<h4>
<a id="text-editor" class="anchor" href="#text-editor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Text editor:</h4>

<p>How do we take the basic functionalities in an editor - opening/saving/closing a file, multiple windows, consoles, switching between windows - and make it feel natural and superior in VR</p>

<p>We encounter technical problems in selecting </p>

<h4>
<a id="environment" class="anchor" href="#environment" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Environment:</h4>

<p>One of the challenge we encounter is how to switch environment for the player. We solved this by creating a list of environment names, and having a script running at start of the project, listening for key press to trigger the function to load next environment in list. When the index of the environment reaches the end of the list, it wraps around to the head of the list.</p>

<p>Another challenge is what type of environment we want, should it be a terrain with bunch of lightnings and objects or should it be just a sky box and where could we get those environments? To make rendering more efficient, we use a Skybox instead of terrain and objects for the representation of environment.Thus it is more efficient to load the background environment. We assume that a player will not walk around while reading and text editing.</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-interface" class="anchor" href="#user-interface" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>User interface:</h4>

<p>Beyond keyboard shortcuts, what are some interfaces we can adopt that will enhance the VR experience?
Eg. if we have a console we can have the console follow head tracking, whereas the editor stay at their positions.</p>

<a id="what-works-well" class="anchor" href="#what-works-well" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What Works Well</h3>

<h4>
<a id="text-editor-1" class="anchor" href="#text-editor-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Text editor:</h4>

<p>Press command+space and launch a spotlight search bar to quickly search/open files, websites</p>

<h4>
<a id="environment-1" class="anchor" href="#environment-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Environment:</h4>

<p>What kind of background makes the user most efficient? It could be a lakeside cabin or a trippy wormhole. Maybe helpful for writing novels. The trick is one could be most efficient in a open space environment like a forest or skyline while the other could be most efficient in a closed environment such as a study room. To adjust such diversity, we include multiple types of environment to suit different users' preferences: sunrise, sunset, forests, study room, space station etc.</p>

<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
